## 1. The RSS Crawler

Polling sources for news, information or updates is not fun at all. The easiest lowest common denominator for polling and crawling interesting information can be a rss feed.
Anonymity is the biggest advantage of crawling information from social media or website without using an account.
The administration of the data-sources can be done by a simple web-interface or a config file. Another benefit of an rss crawler is decentralisation, you don't rely on any 3rd party provider.


## 2. The Universal Data Logger

Possibility for storing all kind of information like temperature data, door sensors or anything you like. Add a new dataset on a web-interface define a label for it. You can store and recall the data. For every record you can store a value, time and location. The identification for storing informations is based by an UID.


## 3. The Data Visualizer

Sometimes you have all kind of data like historic temperature data and just don't have anything handy for a interactive visualization. The solution is a online data visualization, just paste or post your data and view graphs interactive in your webbrowser.

A different approach could be a simple fully client side (js,html) website that can be used offline. So you can save the website and use it like an app on all deviced.


## 4. The City Assistant

This idea is about combining many already existing features of today’s most popular services.
We already have many map-services, social networks, various applications on disposal, as well
as shopping services. This application will be organized around one city (each city will have independent subservice) and everything, what that city has to offer. The idea is to integrate culture-tourism and all other providers/suppliers of one town, as well as people with same interests, into one lifestyle, which all participants can contribute and further develop.

The application will contain all registered stores-suppliers (also shops, bars, clubs...) in one
google-maps like interface, which will be displayed to the user, based on the user’s current
location. These registered stores-suppliers (further referred as "providers") will have their
description, images, reviews, special offers, advanced search for offered services/products.
User can simply search for the product/service, and the search results containing the
providers, and their offers, nearby (also can be combined with public transport or suggested
taxi-driver contacts), will be offered to him.

Since the idea is not limited with the hardware, it is possible to change/modify or add any
additional content. For example, since every city has its own assistant, by combining them,
it is possible to make "Traveling Assistant" which can improve traveling experience in one
area. This can be also turned into something similar to social network (or be connected to
one), where people can share their experiences and suggestions in order to achieve better
communication between providers and users.

## 5. The Object Scanner Assistant

The "Object Scanner Assistant" is mainly made as an application (desktop/android/IOS), or as a plug in
to Your browser. The idea is to use image processing algorithms to scan the visual of some
object and to search the data base, for the same object to get further information: Where it
can be bought, Services which offer this object, prices and locations. This can be very useful
for fashion and shopping. Assuming that this project will use an application for android (on the users side), user will
register to this application, providing location services and will be able to upload a several
pictures of the object he wants to search. The user will then receive several suggestions
from the server, including location of stores containing this object or similar objects, as a
suggestion (purple shoes come in different shapes and features, but are essentially purple
shoes).

Using image processing and computer vision features is never easy. It is important to have
good classifiers, which are well trained with possibility to update them in order to increase
the quality of service. My first thought is to use Viola-Jones framework, made for real-time
object detection, mainly made for purposes of face detection.
In this case, classifiers can be used, with possibility of machine learning and supervised
training, in order to increase the detection and recognition capabilities of this service.


## 6. The Gardening assistant

This project will also include hardware system, necessary to maintain and control one small
Garden, which will be remotely placed (as a box) on the balcony of apartments or in large
room-places (like coffee shops, bars, restaurants, production halls, similar...) serving as a nice
decoration or for small-production-purposes of home made fruits and vegetables. In this case,
this Garden, with its features, serves to improve the current conditions for gardening, and
not to make them, excluding the cases of growing a lemon tree in northern Siberia.

The Garden will be placed on one movable, customizable platform. This platform will
include all features for monitoring and control of the live vegetables, one Central Computer
with WiFi module and Solar Panels (also external power supply). Central Computer will have access to all gardening features and will collect and control the features as well as online APIs (e.g., for weather data)

Gardening features will be implemented as hardware modules, attached to Central Computer (e.g.,  watering, management of special soil ingredients, sensing, covers, artificial lighting, heating/cooling,...)

Application will be made for interaction between user and Central Computer. Since Central
Computer is on WiFi, it is possible to remotely access it, from anywhere. Central Computer can collect informations from sensors and access features, user can request these informations or send commands to Central Computer.
Example: Central Computer access weather services, make estimation for next few days,
send that to user, saying that drought will happen, suggesting watering. User can send
commands for features and requests for data, anytime to the Central Computer.

It is possible to use learning algorithms, also to make a smart gardening community which
will provide feedback to developers and other users, improving the quality of service and
making this product even better.
Garden Assistant can come in many different shapes and sizes, making some models fit for
indoor use.


## 7. The Voice-Controlled Bicycle Light

Bike lights have to be turned on when it gets dark. These application combines bike light and
micro controller which has mobile Internet access and microphone attached to it. It can be controlled
with the aid of voice recognition. Thus, bicycle rider does not have to take his/hers hands off from the handlebar when switching the lights on or off. This is especially handy when the lights are located in the rear of the bike. The light and the micro controller are powered by battery


## 8. Rent my Bike

When somebody wants to rent his/hers bike he/she can set it available for renting using this
device. The device will be attached into the bikes body. The device also works as a “smart lock” which
the user can open by reading a QR-code or unlocking it with web service (website or app). The device contains GPS and mobile broadband modem, so it can connect to Internet. Bike renters get X% of the profit and the service provider takes the rest. Installing the device is free/costs very little and can only be done by accredited person. The device has a battery which can be recharged by using dynamo or
USB cable.


## 9. Visit my Sauna

Basically like Air BnB but for saunas. Especially intended to use in Finland where it’s estimated that there are two million saunas, for a population of 5.3 million and many households have
their own saunas. People register to Visit my Sauna mobile application and are then allowed to set their saunas available for others to book. Moreover, users can search for saunas suitable for them. Sauna renters can decide the fees for each booking, saunas maximum capacity, opening hours, and other rules that should be obeyed.

(Not quite sure if the sauna idea fulfills all the assignment requirements. Alternative idea for that could be a web application that shows optimal way to heat the sauna (if it’s wood-heated) and the estimation of the time it takes to achieve wanted temperature in the sauna. Then there would be a remote thermometer installed in the sauna.)


## 10. The Smart Parking Service

People often end up in a situation when they are travelling by car and they must spend way too long time for finding a free parking spot. For those moments of frustration, a service capable of assigning a free parking spot on a location of your choice, could bring help for the parking problem. A smart parking service could resolve these problems by ending the never-ending hunt for free parking spots.

When using the service user could request a parking spot from a location of their choice and the service would assign and reserve a free parking spot from that place. User could reserve the spot in advance to ensure the availably of the spot and if the user doesn’t arrive on time the system can reallocate the space for new users. The service could also include components like billing or voice guided navigation to the parking lot.


## 11. The Restaurant Table Reservation System

To reserve a table in a restaurant people often first need to find the phone number of the restaurant and then personally make a phone call to reserve a table on their time choice. Finding this suitable time can be a hard task when the user needs to figure out the schedule of the restaurant by verbally asking and somehow trying to find free times that would fit users own schedule. At the age of SMS and other text messaging platforms some users find making the phone call too demanding and making a phone call isn’t just possible in some situations. To make table reservation easier a digital service could offer its users possibility to make table reservations over the internet and without need for a phone call.

A reservation service could present the user the selected restaurants table schedule in a calendar from and so easily allowing the user to find free times from the schedule. A map of the available tables could be incorporated to the calendar view, so user can also pick the table according to it’s location. This system can be made completely independent by mapping the availability of tables that are reserved but the whose customers never made a reservation for the table (people who just walked in). The mapping of these table can be achieved by using sensor to determine the availability of individual tables. Reserved table whose reserves never came could be offered to other customers.


## 12. The Food Pick-up Service

After a day of hard work or returning from a long trip it may feel really tiring to go to a grocery store to get something to fill the empty refrigerator waiting back home. Walking through the endless corridors at a supermarket just to find the couple items you really need and spending way too much time just wandering inside the store. Doing groceries can be made simpler by introducing a food pickup service where users could choose and pay their products from an online web service and later just pick up the already collected groceries from a pick-up point.

Users could decide what to purchase from the online store and the webstores product selection would change according to the stock data at the pick-up location. After selecting the products, users can pick-up their products from a locker system where user only needs to input a code to the locker systems computer to open the locker containing user’s groceries.
